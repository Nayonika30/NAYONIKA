<p>Happiness is a type of felling which cause inner piece.
 If a person is happy from inside he can spread his happiness in his surrounding also. 
Happiness can not be defined in a particular direction or work bit it can be vary from person 
to person like one can be happy with music or dance.
One can be feel piece in prayer of GOD or by serving needy people by giving them their needs articles.
One can be happy with friends and family or one can get happiness by working in home or outside. 
One can feel happy to be with his lil sweet pet or his own little garden.
Happiness is like not explainable in words its beyond words bcz feelings can't be expressed in words.</p>
